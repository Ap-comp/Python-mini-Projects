# Pandas Mini Practice – Lesson 2

This notebook is a hands-on practice after completing Lesson 2 of the Kaggle Pandas course.

## 📌 Tasks Performed
- Loaded a dataset using `pd.read_csv()`
- Filtered rows where age > 25
- Selected specific columns (`name`, `city`)
- Created a new column called `age_group` based on age
- Saved the filtered output to `filtered_output.csv`

## 📂 Files Included
- `Pandas_Mini_Practice.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with all code
- `data.csv` – Sample input dataset
- `filtered_output.csv` – Output file generated by the notebook

## 🛠 Libraries Used
- pandas

## ✅ Status
Practice complete and results pushed to GitHub.  
More advanced tasks will be added as we continue the journey!

## 📝 Summary

This mini project applies the core concepts learned in Kaggle Pandas Lesson 2.  
It includes basic data loading, filtering, column selection, feature engineering, and CSV output.

The goal was to reinforce practical use of Pandas for real-world data handling tasks,  
and prepare for more advanced data analysis and machine learning workflows.

This exercise builds confidence in:
- Using Boolean filters
- Creating new columns with `apply()`
- Exporting data with Pandas

Next step: deeper data wrangling and real-world datasets.
