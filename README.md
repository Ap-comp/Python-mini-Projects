# Python Mini Projects 🐍

This repository contains beginner-friendly Python scripts created as part of my journey to transition into AI/ML engineering. Each script focuses on solving a specific logic-building problem, and all are built from scratch using core Python.

## 💻 What's Included

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧮 Prime Checker | Check if a number is prime using efficient looping logic |
| ➕ Simple Calculator | Add or subtract two numbers using functions and input handling |
| 🔤 Vowel Counter | Count the number of vowels in a given sentence |
| 🔁 Palindrome Checker | Check if a word reads the same forwards and backwards |
| 📊 Most Frequent Character | Find the most frequent non-space character in a sentence |
| 🧬 String Compression | Compress repeated characters into character counts (e.g., `aaabb` → `a3b2`) |

## 🚀 Why This Repo

These are my early projects while learning Python fundamentals. They help solidify core concepts like:
- Input/output handling
- Conditionals (`if/else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- String manipulation
- Function building
- Dictionary usage

## 📅 Timeline

- Started: July 2025
- Goal: Become an AI/ML Engineer by Jan 2026

## 🧠 Still Learning

More projects and enhancements coming soon:
- File handling
- CSV/JSON processing
- Pandas & NumPy
- Data cleaning scripts
