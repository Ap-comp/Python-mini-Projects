## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Reading and writing **Text files (.txt)**
- Creating and processing **CSV files (.csv)**
- Working with **JSON files (.json)**
- Using Python libraries: `csv`, `json`, and file context managers (`with open()`)

---

## 🔧 Technologies

- Language: Python 3
- Libraries: Built-in `csv`, `json`

- `data.csv` – Sample table of names and ages
- `students.json` – Nested student data in JSON format

---

## 📄 Key Functions

- `open()`, `read()`, `write()`
- `csv.writer`, `csv.DictReader`
- `json.dump()`, `json.load()`
